		<p class="date">10 November 2017</p>
		

  
  
    
      
        
  
  <p>
    Today we celebrate 8 years since Go was released as an open source project.


    During <a href="https://blog.golang.org/4years" target="_blank">Go’s 4th anniversary</a>, Andrew


    finished the post with “Here&#39;s to four more years!”. Now that we have reached


    that milestone, I cannot help but reflect on how much the project and


    ecosystem has grown since then. In our post 4 years ago we included a chart


    demonstrating Go&#39;s rising popularity on Google Trends with the search term


    &#34;golang&#34;. Today, we’re including an updated chart. In this relative scale of


    popularity, what was 100 four years ago is now a mere 17. Go’s popularity has


    increased exponentially over the last 8 years and continues to grow.

  <h4 id="TOC_1.1.">Developers love Go</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    Go has been embraced by developers all over the world with approximately one


    million users worldwide. In the <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/" target="_blank">freshly published 2017 Octoverse</a> 


    by GitHub, <b>Go has become the #9 most popular language</b>, surpassing C.


    <b>Go is the fastest growing language on GitHub in 2017</b> in the top 10 with


    <b>52% growth over the previous year</b>. In growth, Go swapped places with


    Javascript, which fell to the second spot with 44%.

  <h4 id="TOC_1.2.">Go: The language of Cloud Infrastructure</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    In 2014, analyst Donnie Berkholz called Go 


    <a href="http://redmonk.com/dberkholz/2014/03/18/go-the-emerging-language-of-cloud-infrastructure/" target="_blank">the emerging language of cloud infrastructure</a>.


    <b>By 2017, Go has emerged as the language of cloud infrastructure</b>. 


    Today, <b>every single cloud company has critical components of their cloud infrastructure implemented in Go</b>


    including Google Cloud, AWS, Microsoft Azure, Digital Ocean, Heroku and many others. Go


    is a key part of cloud companies like Alibaba, Cloudflare, and Dropbox. Go is


    a critical part of open infrastructure including Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry,


    Openshift, NATS, Docker, Istio, Etcd, Consul, Juju and many more. Companies


    are increasingly choosing Go to build cloud infrastructure solutions.
  </p>
  


      
        
  <h4 id="TOC_1.3.">Go’s Great Community</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    It may be hard to imagine that only four years ago the Go community was


    transitioning from online-only to include in-person community with its first


    conference. Now the Go community has had over 30 conferences all around the


    world with hundreds of presentations and tens of thousands of attendees.


    There are hundreds of Go meetups meeting monthly covering much of the globe.


    Wherever you live, you are likely to find a Go meetup nearby.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Two different organizations have been established to help with inclusivity in


    the Go community, Go Bridge and Women Who Go; the latter has grown to over 25


    chapters. Both have been instrumental in offering free trainings. In 2017


    alone over 50 scholarships to conferences have been given through efforts of


    Go Bridge and Women Who Go.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    This year we had two significant firsts for the Go project. We had our first


    <a href="https://blog.golang.org/contributors-summit" target="_blank">contributor summit</a> where people from across the Go community came together to


    discuss the needs and future of the Go project. Shortly after, we had the


    first <a href="https://blog.golang.org/contributor-workshop" target="_blank">Go contributor workshop</a> 


    where hundreds of people came to make their first Go contribution.

  <h4 id="TOC_1.4.">Go’s impact on open source </h4>
  
  
  <p>
    Go has become a major force in the world of open source powering some of the


    most popular projects and enabling innovations across many industries. Find


    thousands of additional applications and libraries at <a href="https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go" target="_blank">awesome-go</a>. Here are


    just a handful of the most popular:
  </p>
  

  <ul>
  
    <li><a href="https://mobyproject.org/" target="_blank">Moby</a> (formerly Docker) is a tool for packaging and running applications in lightweight containers. Its creator Solomon Hykes cited Go&#39;s standard library, concurrency primitives, and ease of deployment as key factors, and said &#34;To put it simply, if Docker had not been written in Go, it would not have been as successful.&#34;</li>
  
  </ul>

  <ul>
  
    <li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> is a system for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications. Initially designed by Google and used in the Google cloud, Kubernetes now is a critical part of every major cloud offering. </li>
  
  </ul>

  <ul>
  
    <li><a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a> is now the most popular open-source static website engine. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again. According to <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all" target="_blank">w3techs</a>, Hugo now has nearly 3x the usage of Jekyll, the former leader. </li>
  
  </ul>

  <ul>
  
    <li><a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank">Prometheus</a> is an open source monitoring solution and time series database that powers metrics and alerting designed to be the system you go to during an outage to allow you to quickly diagnose problems.</li>
  
  </ul>

  <ul>
  
    <li><a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank">Grafana</a> is an open source, feature-rich metrics dashboard and graph editor for Graphite, Elasticsearch, OpenTSDB, Prometheus and InfluxDB.</li>
  
  </ul>

  <ul>
  
    <li><a href="https://getlantern.org/" target="_blank">Lantern</a> delivers fast, reliable and secure access to blocked websites and apps. </li>
  
  </ul>

  <ul>
  
    <li><a href="https://syncthing.net/" target="_blank">Syncthing</a> is an open-source cross platform peer-to-peer continuous file synchronization application</li>
  
  </ul>

  <ul>
  
    <li><a href="https://keybase.io/" target="_blank">Keybase</a> is a new and free security app for mobile phones and computers. Think of it as an open source Dropbox &amp; Slack with end-to-end encryption public-key cryptography. </li>
  
  </ul>

  <ul>
  
    <li><a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf" target="_blank">Fzf</a> is an interactive Unix filter for command-line that can be used with any list; files, command history, processes, hostnames, bookmarks, git commits, etc. Fzf supports Unix, macOS and has beta support for Windows. It also can operate as a vim plugin. </li>
  
  </ul>

  
  <p>
    Many of these authors have said that their projects would not exist without


    Go. Some like Kubernetes and Docker created entirely new solutions. Others


    like Hugo, Syncthing and Fzf created more refined experiences where many


    solutions already existed. The popularity of these applications alone is


    proof that Go is a ideal language for a broad set of use cases.
  </p>
  


      
        
  <h4 id="TOC_1.5.">Thank You</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    This is the eighth time we have had the pleasure of writing a birthday blog


    post for Go and we continue to be overwhelmed by and grateful for the


    enthusiasm and support of the Go community.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Since Go was first open sourced we have had 10 releases of the language,


    libraries and tooling with more than 1680 contributors making over 50,000


    commits to the project&#39;s 34 repositories; More than double the number of


    contributors and nearly double the number of commits from only <a href="https://blog.golang.org/6years" target="_blank">two years ago</a>.


    This year we announced that we have begun planning <a href="https://blog.golang.org/toward-go2" target="_blank">Go 2</a>, our first major


    revision of the language and tooling.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    The Go team would like to thank everyone who has contributed to the project,


    whether you participate by contributing changes, reporting bugs, sharing your


    expertise in design discussions, writing blog posts or books, running events,


    attending or speaking at events, helping others learn or improve, open


    sourcing Go packages you wrote, contributing artwork, introducing Go to


    someone, or being part of the Go community. Without you, Go would not be as


    complete, useful, or successful as it is today. 
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Thank you, and here’s to eight more years!
  </p>

  <h4 id="TOC_1.">Announcing the Go Community Outreach Working Group</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    The Go project has grown considerably with over half a million users and


    community members all over the world. To date all community oriented activities


    have been organized by the community with minimal involvement from the Go


    project. We greatly appreciate these efforts.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    After talking to many community organizers we have heard consistent


    feedback that they would like better collaboration between organizers and


    the Go project. We are forming the Community outreach Working Group (CWG)


    to help support these community efforts.
  </p>
  


    
      
  <h4 id="TOC_2.">The CWG Mission</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    The mission of the CWG is to act as a conduit between the broader Go


    community, it’s organizers and the Go project. The CWG will help provide


    the structures and community management necessary to create an online and


    in person community that is enjoyable and rewarding to participate in. The


    CWG leadership represents the Go project in these efforts.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    <b>The CWG is responsible for:</b>
  </p>
  

  <ul>
  
    <li>Defining programs to facilitate deeper collaboration across the community.</li>
  
    <li>Facilitating the coordination of Go events</li>
  
    <li>Establishing growth and expansion plans for the community</li>
  
    <li>Project exposure and accessibility</li>
  
    <li>Ecosystem Development</li>
  
  </ul>

  <h4 id="TOC_3.">Plans for Action</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    The CWG has an <a href="https://github.com/golang/cwg" target="_blank">open GitHub repo</a> we’ve created for complete transparency


    of our efforts.  We have various <a href="https://github.com/golang/cwg/projects" target="_blank">GitHub projects</a> which are acting as our


    primary initiatives. Each project has a variety of <a href="https://github.com/golang/cwg/issues" target="_blank">issues</a> tied to them

	<div class="article" data-slug="/go1.9">
		<h3 class="title"><a href="/go1.9">Go 1.9 is released</a></h3>
		<p class="date">24 August 2017</p>
		

  
  
    
      
        
  
  <p>
    Today the Go team is happy to announce the release of Go 1.9.


    You can get it from the <a href="https://golang.org/dl/" target="_blank">download page</a>.


    There are many changes to the language, standard library, runtime, and tooling.


    This post covers the most significant visible ones.


    Most of the engineering effort put into this release went to improvements of the runtime and tooling,


    which makes for a less exciting announcement, but nonetheless a great release.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    The most important change to the language is the introduction of type aliases: a feature


    created to support gradual code repair. A type alias declaration has the form:
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <div class="code"><pre>type T1 = T2</pre></div>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    This declaration introduces an alias name <code>T1</code> for the type <code>T2</code>, in the same way that <code>byte</code> has


    always been an alias for <code>uint8</code>.


    The <a href="https://golang.org/design/18130-type-alias" target="_blank">type alias design document</a> and


    <a href="https://talks.golang.org/2016/refactor.article" target="_blank">an article on refactoring</a> cover this addition in more detail.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    The new <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/math/bits" target="_blank">math/bits</a> package provides bit counting and manipulation functions


    for unsigned integers, implemented by special CPU instructions when possible.


    For example, on x86-64 systems, <code>bits.TrailingZeros(x)</code> uses the


    <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2010/readings/i386/BSF.htm" target="_blank">BSF</a> instruction.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    The <code>sync</code> package has added a new <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync#Map" target="_blank">Map</a> type, safe for concurrent access.


    You can read more about it from its documentation and learn more about why it was created from this


    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1EtfDnsdDs" target="_blank">GopherCon 2017 lightning talk</a>


    (<a href="https://github.com/gophercon/2017-talks/blob/master/lightningtalks/BryanCMills-AnOverviewOfSyncMap/An%20Overview%20of%20sync.Map.pdf" target="_blank">slides</a>).


    It is not a general replacement for Go&#39;s map type; please see the documentation to learn when it should be used.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    The <code>testing</code> package also has an addition. The new <code>Helper</code> method, added to both


    <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/testing#T.Helper" target="_blank">testing.T</a> and <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/testing#B.Helper" target="_blank">testing.B</a>,


    marks the calling function as a test helper function.


    When the testing package prints file and line information, it shows the location of the call to a helper function


    instead of a line in the helper function itself.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    For example, consider this test:
  </p>
  

      
        
  
	<div class="code">


<pre><span num="7">package p</span>
<span num="8"></span>
<span num="9">import &#34;testing&#34;</span>
<span num="10"></span>
<span num="11">func failure(t *testing.T) {</span>
<span num="12">    t.Helper() // This call silences this function in error reports.</span>
<span num="13">    t.Fatal(&#34;failure&#34;)</span>
<span num="14">}</span>
<span num="15"></span>
<span num="16">func Test(t *testing.T) {</span>

<span num="18">}</span>
</pre>


</div>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Because <code>failure</code> identifies itself as a test helper, the error message printed during <code>Test</code> will indicate line 11,


    where <code>failure</code> is called, instead of line 7, where <code>failure</code> calls <code>t.Fatal</code>.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    The <code>time</code> package now transparently tracks monotonic time in each <code>Time</code> value,


    making computing durations between two <code>Time</code> values a safe operation in the presence of wall clock adjustments.


    For example, this code now computes the right elapsed time even across a leap second clock reset:
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <div class="code"><pre>start := time.Now()
f()
elapsed := time.Since(start)</pre></div>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    See the <a href="http://beta.golang.org/pkg/time/#hdr-Monotonic_Clocks" target="_blank">package docs</a> and


    <a href="https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/12914-monotonic.md" target="_blank">design document</a> for details.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Finally, as part of the efforts to make the Go compiler faster, Go 1.9 compiles functions in a package concurrently.
  </p>
  

      
        
  
  <p>
    Go 1.9 includes many more additions, improvements, and fixes. Find the complete set of changes,


    and more information about the improvements listed above, in the

    To celebrate the release, Go User Groups around the world are holding

  <h4 id="TOC_1.1.">Event Overview</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    by <a href="https://twitter.com/spf13" target="_blank">Steve</a>
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    During the community day at GopherCon, the Go team held two workshops


    where we worked with people to help them make their first contribution to the


    Go project. This was the first time the Go project has ever attempted anything


    like this. We had about 140 participants and about 35 people who volunteered as


    mentors. Mentors not only received warm fuzzy feelings for helping others, but


    also a very stylish Go Mentor trucker hat. We had contributors of all


    ages and experience levels coming from North and South America, Africa, Europe,


    Asia, and Australia. It was truly a worldwide effort of Gophers coming together


    at GopherCon.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    One of our reasons for running the workshop was for it to act as a forcing


    function to make us improve our contributor experience. In preparation for the


    workshop, we rewrote our contributor guide, including adding a &#34;troubleshooting&#34;


    section and built a tool <code>go-contrib-init</code>, which automated the process of


    setting up a development environment to be able to contribute to Go.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    For the workshop itself, we developed a presentation <i>&#34;Contributing to Go,&#34;</i>


    and a dashboard / scoreboard that was presented during the event. The


    scoreboard was designed to encourage us all to work together towards a common


    goal of seeing our collective score increase. Participants added 1, 2 or 3 points to


    the total score when they performed actions like registering an account, making


    a change list (also known as a CL, similar to a pull request),


    amending a CL, or submitting a CL.
  </p>

  <p>
    Brad Fitzpatrick, who stayed home from GopherCon this year, was ready and


    waiting to review all CLs submitted. He was so quick to review that many people


    thought he was an automated bot. Internally our team is now calling him


    &#34;BradBot&#34; mostly because we are in awe and a bit jealous.

  <h4 id="TOC_1.1.1.">Impact</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    We had a total of 65 CLs submitted from the people who participated in the


    workshop (within a week of the workshop). Of these, 44 were from contributors


    who had never previously contributed to any of the repos in the Go project.


    Half (22) of these contributions were already merged. Many of the others are


    waiting on the codebase to thaw as we are in the middle of a freeze for the


    upcoming 1.9 release. In addition to CLs, many contributed to the project in


    the form of bug reports,


    <a href="https://golang.org/wiki/Gardening" target="_blank">gardening tasks</a>, and other types


    of contributions.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    The most common type of contribution was an example function to be used in the


    documentation. The <a href="https://blog.golang.org/survey2016-results" target="_blank">Go User survey</a>


    identified that our documentation was significantly lacking examples. In the


    presentation, we asked users to find a package they loved and to add an example. In


    the Go project, examples are written as code in Go files


    (with specific naming) and the <code>go doc</code> tool displays them along side the documentation.


    This is a perfect first contribution as it&#39;s something that can be merged


    during a freeze, it&#39;s of critical importance to our users, and it&#39;s an addition


    that has a relatively narrow scope.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    One of the examples added is that of creating a Stringer, one of the more


    widely used interfaces in Go.


    <a href="https://golang.org/cl/49270/" target="_blank">CL 49270</a>
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    In addition to examples, many people contributed critical bug fixes including:
  </p>
  

  <ul>
  
    <li><a href="https://golang.org/cl/48988/" target="_blank">CL 48988</a> fixing <a href="https://golang.org/issue/21029" target="_blank">issue #21029</a></li>
  
    <li><a href="https://golang.org/cl/49050/" target="_blank">CL 49050</a> fixing <a href="https://golang.org/issue/20054" target="_blank">issue #20054</a></li>
  
    <li><a href="https://golang.org/cl/49031/" target="_blank">CL 49031</a> fixing <a href="https://golang.org/issue/20166" target="_blank">issue #20166</a></li>
  
    <li><a href="https://golang.org/cl/49170/" target="_blank">CL 49170</a> fixing <a href="https://golang.org/issue/20877" target="_blank">issue #20877</a></li>
  
  </ul>

  
  <p>
    Some people even surprised us by arriving with a bug in mind that they wanted


    to fix. Nikhita arrived ready to tackle


    <a href="https://golang.org/issue/20786" target="_blank">issue #20786</a>


    and she did submitting


    <a href="https://golang.org/cl/48871/" target="_blank">CL 48871</a>,


    after which she tweeted:
  </p>

</div>

  
  <p>
    Not only were some great improvements made, but most importantly, we narrowed


    the gap between the core Go team and the broader community members. Many people


    on the Go team remarked that the community members were teaching them things


    about the Go project. People in the community (in person, and on Twitter)


    remarked that felt welcome to participate in the project.

  <h4 id="TOC_1.1.2.">Future</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    The event was successful well beyond our expectations. Sameer Ajmani, Go team


    manager said, &#34;The contributor workshop was incredibly fun and educational–for


    the Go team.  We cringed as users hit the rough edges in our process, and


    celebrated when they got up on the dashboard. The cheer when the group score


    hit 1000 was awesome.&#34;
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    We are looking into ways to make this workshop easier to run for future events


    (like meetups and conferences). Our biggest challenge is providing enough


    mentorship so that users feel supported. If you have any ideas or would like to


    help with this process please <a href="mailto:spf@golang.org" target="_blank">let me know</a>.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    I&#39;ve asked a few participants of the event to share their experiences below:

  <p>
    When I heard about the go-contrib workshop I was very excited and then I was


    extremely intimidated. I was encouraged by a member of the Go team to


    participate, so I thought what the heck.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    As I walked into the room (let&#39;s be real, I ran into the room because I was


    running late) I was pleased to see the room was jam-packed. I looked around for


    people in Gopher caps, which was the main indicator they were teachers. I sat


    down at one of the 16 round tables that had two hats and three non-hats.


    Brought up my screen and was ready to roll…
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Jess Frazelle stood up and started the presentation and provided the group with


    <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ap2fycBSgoo-jCswhK9lqgCIFroE1pYpsXC1ffYBCq4/edit#slide=id.p" target="_blank">a link</a>


    to make it easy to follow.
  </p>
  

<div class="image">
  <img src="contributor-workshop/image16.png">
</div>

  
  <p>
    The murmurs grew from a deep undercurrent to a resounding melody of voices,


    people were getting their computers set up with Go, they were skipping ahead to


    make sure their GOPATH was set, and were… wait what&#39;s Gerrit?
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Most of us had to get a little intro to Gerrit. I had no clue what it was, but


    luckily there was a handy slide. Jess explained that it was an alternative to


    GitHub with slightly more advanced code review tools. We then went through


    GitHub vs Geritt terminology, so we had better understanding of the process.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ok, now it was time to become a <b> freaking*</b> <b>Go</b> <b> contributor*</b>.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    To make this more exciting than it already is, the Go team set up a game where


    we could track as a group how many points we could rack up based on the Gerrit


    score system.
  </p>
  

<div class="image">

</div>

  
  <p>
    Seeing your name pop up on the board and listening to everyone&#39;s excitement was


    intoxicating. It also invoked a sense of teamwork that lead to a feeling of


    inclusion and feeling like you were truly a part of the Go community.
  </p>
  

<div class="image">
  <img src="contributor-workshop/image11.png">
</div>

  
  <p>
    In 6 steps a room of around 80 people were able to learn how to contribute to


    go within an hour. That&#39;s a feat!
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    It wasn&#39;t nearly as difficult as I anticipated and it wasn&#39;t out of scope for a


    total newbie. It fostered a sense of community in an active and tangible way as


    well as a sense of inclusion in the illustrious process of Go contributions.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    I&#39;d personally like to thank the Go Team, the Gopher mentors in hats, and my


    fellow participants for making it one of my most memorable moments at


    GopherCon.

  <h4 id="TOC_1.3.">My Contribution Experience</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    by <a href="https://twitter.com/mbbroberg" target="_blank">Matt</a>
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    I&#39;ve always found programming languages to be intimidating. It&#39;s the code that


    enables the world to write code. Given the impact, surely smarter people than


    me should be working on it... but that fear was something to overcome. So when


    the opportunity to join a workshop to contribute to my new favorite programming


    language came up, I was excite to see how I could and how I could help. A month


    later, I&#39;m now certain that anyone and everyone can (and should) contribute back to Go.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Here are my very verbose steps to go from 0 to 2 contributions to Go:
  </p>
  

  <h4 id="TOC_1.3.1.">The Setup</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    Given Go&#39;s use of Gerrit, I started by setting up my environment for it. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ap2fycBSgoo-jCswhK9lqgCIFroE1pYpsXC1ffYBCq4/edit#slide=id.g1f953ef7df_0_9" target="_blank">Jess Frazzelle&#39;s guide</a>


    is a great place to start to not miss a step.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    The real fun starts when you clone the Go repo. Ironically, you don&#39;t hack on


    Go under <code>$GOPATH</code>, so I put it in my other workspace (which is <code>~/Develop</code>).
  </p>
  

  
  <div class="code"><pre>cd $DEV # That&#39;s my source code folder outside of $GOPATH
git clone --depth 1 https://go.googlesource.com/go</pre></div>
  

  
  <p>
    Then install the handy dandy helper tool, <code>go-contrib-init</code>:
  </p>
  

  
  <div class="code"><pre>go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/go-contrib-init</pre></div>
  

  
  <p>
    Now you can run <code>go-contrib-init</code> from the <code>go/</code> folder we cloned above and see


    whether or not we&#39;re ready to contribute. But hold on if you&#39;re following along,


    you&#39;re not ready just yet.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Next, install <code>codereview</code> so you can participate in a Gerrit code review:
  </p>
  

  
  <div class="code"><pre>go get -u golang.org/x/review/git-codereview</pre></div>
  

  
  <p>
    This package includes `git change` and `git mail` which will replace your


    normal workflow of `git commit` and `git push` respectively.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Okay, installations are out of the way. Now setup your <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/settings/#Profile" target="_blank">Gerrit account here</a>,


    then <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/settings#Agreements" target="_blank">sign the CLA</a> appropriate for


    you (I signed a personal one for all Google projects, but choose the right option for you.


    You can see all CLAs you&#39;ve signed at <a href="https://cla.developers.google.com/clas" target="_blank">cla.developers.google.com/clas</a>).
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    AND BAM. You&#39;re good (to go)! But where to contribute?
  </p>
  


  <h4 id="TOC_1.3.2.">Contributing</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    In the workshop, they sent us into the <code>scratch</code> repository, which is a safe place to


    fool around in order to master the workflow:
  </p>
  

  
  <div class="code"><pre>cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/golang.org/x
git clone --depth 1 [[https://go.googlesource.com/scratch][go.googlesource.com/scratch]]</pre></div>
  

  
  <p>
    First stop is to <code>cd</code> in and run <code>go-contrib-init</code> to make sure you&#39;re ready to contribute:
  </p>
  

  
  <div class="code"><pre>go-contrib-init
All good. Happy hacking!</pre></div>
  

  
  <p>
    From there, I made a folder named after my GitHub account, did a `git add -u`


    then took `git change` for a spin. It has a hash that keeps track of your work,


    which is the one line you shouldn&#39;t touch. Other than that, it feels just like


    `git commit`. Once I got the commit message matching the format of


    `package: description` (description begins with a lowercase), I used


    `git mail` to send it over to Gerrit.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Two good notes to take at this point: `git change` also works like `git commit --amend`, so


    if you need to update your patch you can <code>add</code> then <code>change</code> and it will all


    link to the same patch. Secondly, you can always review your patch from your


    <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/dashboard/" target="_blank">personal Gerrit dashboard</a>.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    After a few back and forths, I officially had a contribute to Go! And if Jaana


    is right, it might be the first with emojis ✌️.

  <h4 id="TOC_1.3.3.">Contributing, For Real</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    The scratch repo is fun and all, but there&#39;s a ton of ways to get into the


    depths of Go&#39;s packages and give back. It&#39;s at this point where I cruised


    around the many packages available to see what was available and interesting to


    me. And by &#34;cruised around&#34; I mean attempted to find a list of packages, then


    went to my source code to see what&#39;s around under the <code>go/src/</code> folder:
  </p>
  

<div class="image">
  <img src="contributor-workshop/image22.png">
</div>

  
  <p>
    I decided to see what I can do in the <code>regexp</code> package, maybe out of love and


    fear of regex. Here&#39;s where I switched to the


    <a href="https://godoc.org/regexp" target="_blank">website&#39;s view of the package</a> (it&#39;s good to know


    that each standard package can be found at https://godoc.org/$PACKAGENAME). In


    there I noticed that <code>QuoteMeta</code> was missing the same level of detailed examples


    other functions have (and I could use the practice using Gerrit).
  </p>
  

<div class="image">
  <img src="contributor-workshop/image1.png">
</div>

  
  <p>
    I started looking at <code>go/src/regexp</code> to try to find where to add examples and I


    got lost pretty quickly. Lucky for me, <a href="https://twitter.com/francesc" target="_blank">Francesc</a> was around that day. He walked


    me through how all examples are actually in-line tests in a `example_test.go


    file. They follow the format of test cases followed by &#34;Output&#34; commented out


    and then the answers to the tests. For example:
  </p>
  

  
  <div class="code"><pre>func ExampleRegexp_FindString() {
    re := regexp.MustCompile(&#34;fo.?&#34;)
    fmt.Printf(&#34;%q\n&#34;, re.FindString(&#34;seafood&#34;))
    fmt.Printf(&#34;%q\n&#34;, re.FindString(&#34;meat&#34;))
    // Output:
    // &#34;foo&#34;
    // &#34;&#34;
}</pre></div>
  

  
  <p>
    Kind of cool, right?? I followed Francesc&#39;s lead and added a function


    <code>ExampleQuoteMeta</code> and added a few I thought would be helpful. From there it&#39;s


    a `git change` and `git mail` to Gerrit!
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    I have to say that Steve Francia challenged me to &#34;find something that isn&#39;t an


    open issue and fix it,&#34; so I included some documentation changes for QuoteMeta


    in my patch. It&#39;s going to be open for a bit longer given the additional scope,


    but I think it&#39;s worth it on this one.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    I can hear your question already: how did I verify it worked? Well it wasn&#39;t


    easy to be honest. Running `go test example_test.go -run QuoteMeta -v` won&#39;t do


    it since we&#39;re working outside of our $GOPATH. I struggled to figure it out


    until <a href="https://medium.com/@vCabbage/go-testing-standard-library-changes-1e9cbed11339" target="_blank">Kale Blakenship wrote this awesome post on testing in Go</a>.


    Bookmark this one for later.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    You can see my completed <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/49130/" target="_blank">contribution here</a>. What I also hope you see is


    how simple it is to get into the flow of contributing. If you&#39;re like me,


    you&#39;ll be good at finding a small typo or missing example in the docs to start to


    get used to the `git codereview` workflow. After that, you&#39;ll be ready to find


    an open issue, ideally one <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/milestones" target="_blank">tagged for an upcoming release</a>, and give it a go. No matter


    what you choose to do, definitely go forth and do it. The Go team proved to me


    just how much they care about helping us all contribute back. I can&#39;t wait for


    my next `git mail`.

  <h4 id="TOC_1.4.">My Mentorship Experience</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    by <a href="https://twitter.com/shurcooL" target="_blank">Dmitri</a>
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    I was looking forward to participating in the Contribution Workshop event as a


    mentor. I had high expectations for the event, and thought it was a great idea


    before it started.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    I made my first contribution to Go on May 10th, 2014. I remember it was about


    four months from the moment I wanted to contribute, until that day, when I


    actually sent my first CL. It took that long to build up the courage and fully


    commit to figuring out the process. I was an experienced software engineer at


    the time. Despite that, the Go contribution process felt alien—being unlike all


    other processes I was already familiar with—and therefore seemed intimidating.


    It was well documented though, so I knew it would be just a matter of finding


    the time, sitting down, and doing it. The &#34;unknown&#34; factor kept me from giving


    it a shot.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    After a few months passed, I thought &#34;enough is enough,&#34; and decided to


    dedicate an entire day of an upcoming weekend to figuring out the process. I


    set aside all of Saturday for doing one thing: sending my first CL to Go. I


    opened up <a href="https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html" target="_blank">the Contribution Guide</a>


    and started following all the steps, from the very top. Within an hour, I was


    done. I had send my first CL. I was both in awe and shock. In awe, because I


    had finally sent a contribution to Go, and it was accepted! In shock, because,


    why did I wait so long to finally do this? Following the steps in


    <a href="https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html" target="_blank">the Contribution Guide</a> was very


    easy, and the entire process went completely smoothly. If only someone had told


    me that I&#39;d be done within an hour and nothing would go wrong, I would&#39;ve done


    it much sooner!
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Which brings me to this event and why I thought it was such a good idea. For


    anyone who ever wanted to contribute to Go, but felt daunted by the unfamiliar


    and seemingly lengthy process (like I was during those four months), this was


    their chance! Not only is it easy to commit to figuring it out by attending the


    event, but also the Go team and helpful volunteer mentors would be there to


    help you along the way.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Despite the already high expectations I had for the event, my expectations were


    exceeded. For one, the Go team had prepared really well and invested a lot in


    making the event that much more enjoyable for everyone. There was a very fun


    presentation that went over all the contributing steps quickly. There was a


    dashboard made for the event, where everyone&#39;s successfully completed steps


    were rewarded with points towards a global score. That made it into a very


    collaborative and social event! Finally, and most importantly, they were Go


    team members like Brad Fitzpatrick behind the scenes, helping review CLs


    promptly! That meant the CLs that were submitted received reviews quickly, with


    actionable next steps, so everyone could move forward and learn more.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    I originally anticipated the event to be somewhat dull, in that the


    contribution steps are extremely simple to follow. However, I found that wasn&#39;t


    always the case, and I was able to use my expertise in Go to help out people


    who got stuck in various unexpected places. It turns out, the real world is


    filled with edge cases. For instance, someone had two git emails, one personal


    and another for work. There was a delay with signing the CLA for the work


    email, so they tried to use their personal email instead. That meant each


    commit had to be amended to use the right email, something the tools didn&#39;t


    take into account. (Luckily, there is a troubleshooting section in the


    contribution guide covering this exact issue!) There were other subtle mistakes


    or environment misconfiguration that some people ran into, because having more


    than one Go installation was a bit unusual. Sometimes, the GOROOT environment


    variable had to be explicitly set, temporarily, to get godoc to show changes in


    the right standard library (I was tongue-in-cheek looking over my shoulder to


    check for Dave Cheney as I uttered those words).
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Overall, I oversaw a few new gophers make their first Go contributions. They


    sent the CLs, responded to review feedback, made edits, iterated until everyone


    was happy, and eventually saw their first Go contributions get merged to


    master! It was very rewarding to see the happiness on their faces, because the


    joy of making one&#39;s first contribution is something I can relate to myself. It


    was also great to be able to help them out, and explain tricky situations that


    they sometimes found themselves. From what I can tell, many happy gophers


    walked away from the event, myself included!
